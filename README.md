# JIRA-CLI

This is (or at least is going to be) a CLI client for JIRA. The idea is to let
the user see all informations on tickets and also do searches, directly from the CLI.

## Installing

As of now, using this project requires Rust nightly. There's a chance it might
work on Stable, I just didn't test it yet. You can install it using `cargo
install`:

`cargo install --git https://github.com/cfcosta/jira-cli`

It works on public JIRAs, if having not oAuth support is a deal-breaker for
you, check back in a week or so, its high on the milestones list.

You are going to need a configuration file to use it, something like this:

`$HOME/.config/jira/config.toml`
```toml
[host]
  hostname = "https://domain.for.my.jira.org"
```
